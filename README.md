# Enrollment System

I created this to practice and showcase my skills in PHP and MySQL.  
This Enrollment System includes features like:  
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- Automatic Student ID Generator  
- Unique ID assignment for each student  
- Database integration for managing student records  

The goal of this project is to provide a simple but functional system for managing student enrollment in a more organized and efficient way.
